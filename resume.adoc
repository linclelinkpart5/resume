= Mark LeMoine

I've been a software engineering professional since 2010, with experience primarily in software development, as well as operations and system administration. I love writing code I'm proud of, and I thoroughly enjoy building small pieces which eventually combine to form grand projects. In addition, I have a fondness for code refactoring, testing, and design, and I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and programming languages to learn and grow.
